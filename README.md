# CP3407Project

Quick Guide for Version Control:

The following only needs to be done once:
1. Create an empty file somewhere you will remember (I did Desktop) that way it is easy to navigate to 
2. Open git bash and navigate to the empty file (cd ~/Desktop/[FILE NAME])
3. Git clone https://github.com/davidrenderos/CP3407Project.git
4. Type git remote add origin https://github.com/davidrenderos/CP3407Project.git
You now have the website ready to work on, pulled directly from the main branch.
